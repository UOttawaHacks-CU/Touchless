## Next Steps
- Fix pages to add questions in speechForm/static
- Update /website pages so there is one option for radio buttons with none of the above
    - For these they need to be changed so if you have any symptoms then send to sick page
    - Only allow submission when one radio button has been selected
- Fix /gestures/customform so that at last page or sick page the page stays up but the camera is deconstructed

### Potential
- DB for data from form to be stored
